# Data Storytelling
This is a data scrollytelling project.

## Details about the data
### All data has been sourced from the [Black Wealth Data Center](https://blackwealthdata.org/)

All numbers have been rounded off to the nearest integer after performing all the calculations.


The numbers 25% and 38% for bachelor's degree attainment have been calculated by taking the average for Black and White respectively from [this chart](https://public.tableau.com/views/BWDC-EducationEmployment-BachelorsDegree/State-LevelBachelorsDegreeAttainment?:language=en-US&padding=0&:embed=y&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:origin=viz_share_link&:display_count=n&position=relative). This is not a weighted average, and hence is the average for a state and not the country.

12% as the average Black population of the United States has been calculated from the data table of [this visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/BWDC-Population-Section1/Dashboard-V1?:language=en-US&padding=0&:embed=y&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:origin=viz_share_link&:display_count=n&position=relative). I took a summation to get the total population and the total Black population and then calculated the percentage.

The number 7% came by directly taking a percentage from [this chart](https://public.tableau.com/views/BWDC-EMP14/EMP14?:language=en-US&padding=0&:embed=y&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:origin=viz_share_link&:display_count=n&position=relative).

The time 5 to 9 minutes was found by finding the number of counties in Texas with each travel time category.
